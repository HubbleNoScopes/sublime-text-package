# sublime-text-package
Sublime editor package is downloadable "sublime-text-package"

Project-in-development. No auto-update & must-reinstall package.

I cannot figure out why the keybinding is not running the macro.
i don't see any errors in the sublime console. 
I added alerts for debugging however i only see the "load success" alert.
Manual keybind to keymap is required. { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+-"], "command": "run_javascript_macro" } is not working..
no current keybind confliction..
